JFK files release from national archives -- forks and pull requests are welcomed.

The `pdf` folder includes all 1,123 files from the US National Archives.  2 files were renamed to conform to generic filesystem naming conventions.

* OCR - low quality - all 31,419 pages from first drop.   Original filenames from the US National Archives are embedded in the text with punctuation removed -- these references can be used to go back to the original image file version.
