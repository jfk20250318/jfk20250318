Hunt states
that in 1960 he was assigned
to the job of organ1z1ng
a
"g9ver~ent
in exile"
for Cuba among
Cuban exiles in Florida.
The
pltn ado ted by the National
Security
Council under P~esident
Eisenho\.ver
called for the formation
and training
of a brigade
of Cuban exiles
who
\vould invade
Cuba,
establish
a provisional
government,
receive
recognition by the United States
and overthro"v
the Castro
government.
The
brigade
had its own air force and was otherwise
fully equipped
by the
United States
Government.
The operation,
hov1ever,
was not supposed
to be one involving
United States
Government
participation.
The venture
was to involve
training
and launching
from outside
the United States.

In connection
with his political
activity
and the organization
of the
government
in exile,
Hunt "vent to Mexico
in 1960. Shortly
thereafter
the Mexican
government
demanded
that they leave and he returned
to
the United States.
Richard
Nixon,
then V~ce President,
was working
closely
with the CIA on the project.

1960, he \vas briefed
When President
Kennedy
was elected
1n November
on the project
and confirmed
the plans,
including
the plan to provide
air
cover to the invading
Cuban force.
In early 1961, however,
the Kennedy
administration
decided
that the political
organization
of the Cuban
government
in exile would have to be broadened
so as to include
all
elements
of the Cuban society.
Even radical
leftwingers
were to be
included.
_ Hunt was assigned
the job of convincing
the leaders
of the
Cuban community
to accept
such a broadening
of the political
structure
of the government
in exile.
Hunt found this to be an impossible
job to
accomplish
because
the Cubans
recruited
to make up the invasion
force
had been promised
that the government
in exile would be solidly
antiCastro
and anti-communist.
Hunt asked to be relieved
of his assignment
because
he thought
it was an impossible
one to achieve
and he returned
to Washington
to ·work on propaganda
and similar
non-political
aspects
of the forthcoming
invasion.

for an airstrike
on Cuba which would have destroyed
the six re,ai~g
combat
planes
that were available
to Castro;
second,
the order
-c-hat
there be no air cover for the invading
brigade.
The result
wa·s that
the invading
force_ was chopped
up \vhile it ·was still in the water;
the
ships carrying
the armored
vehicles
v.1ere sunk, as were the supply
ships,
and the troops
were left abandoned
on the shore.
The remnant
of the Cuban Air Force
\Vas entirely
adequate
to demolish
the invasion
fleet.
Hunt concedes
that he was bitter
about the decisions
made by President
Kennedy,
but he primarily
blames
Arthur
Schlesinger,
Adlai Stevenson
and Robert
Kennedy
for advising
the President
to follow the course
he
chose.
He particularly
feels that the G.1::ans had been recruited
·with
certain
promises
and that those promises
were ·withdrawn
at the last
minute.
Hunt says,
in fact,
that the decision
not to make the airstrike
and not to provide
air cover was made after the invasion
fleet had arrived
at the point of no return,
i.e. , when radio communication
to the invasion
fleet had already
terminated
for security
reasons.
After the Bay of Pigs disaster,
Hunt \vorked with Allen Dulles
until early
1962 at which time, Dulles
was repiaced
as DCI.
In January
1962, Hunt
wa~ assigned
to the Domestic
Operations
Division
of the Deputy Directorate
for Plans.
He was involved
in handling
proprietaries
based in the United
States,
which have their impact
abroad.
His immediate
superior
was
Stanley
Gaines,
who was either
Chief of Operations
or Executive

of the Domestic

Division
and Tracy

who was Division

On November
22, 1963, he and his wife were driving
on H Street
at about
9th in Washington,
D. C., when he turned
the car radio on and learned
that the President
had been shot.
He and Mrs.
Hunt had been shopping
in a Cl\inese
grocery
store in that immediate
vicinity;
immediately
prior
to their getting
into the car.
The Hunts lived at 5215 Balton Road,
Sumner,
Maryland.
On their way home they drove to the Sidwell
Friends
school on ·upper Wisconsin

daughter,
Kevan.
Kevan told them that Robert

were students
in the same school and
had been picked up by the Secret

The minutes
of the June 18, 1964, meeting
(dated
June 22, 1964) •
contained
the following:
[OBTAIN COPY] (signed
by Peter
Jessup)
"A paper was discussed
on alleged
plans which involve
the underworld
to assassinate
certain
Cuban leaders.
Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical
of the reported
_plots and
stated
that
he would like
to go into the matter
further.
Others,
including
.Mr. Bundy, felt
that
the United
States
was
/ being put on notice
and should
do everything
in its power to
asceitain
promptly
the veracity
of the reports
and then underthe
_-take prevention.
It was decided
that Mr. Bundy would call
matter
to the Attorney
General's
attention
as a matter
of law
enforcement."
Mr. McCone's
personal
memorandum for the record
on this
meeting
(dated)
June 18, 1964, contains
substantially
the same
information.
[OBTAIN COPY] It refers
to a June 10, 1964, CIA
memorandum "reporting
plans-of
Cuban exiles
to assassinate
leading
Cuban government
leaders."
This memo apparently
had
been sent to Special
Group members and the Attorney
General.
[OBTAIN COPY] McCone's
memo contains
the following:
"ACTION: Discuss
with General
Carter
and Mr. Helms steps
we
should
take to establish
the credibility
of the_ report;
also
com_rnunica te with the FBI through
Mr. Papich-.
Also I should
call
the Attorney
General
personally."
The official
minutes
of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee
meeting
(dated
July 31, 1964) (referred
to in 1967 IG report)
contain
no mention
of assassination
or even of Cuba.
Mr. McCone's
personal
memorandum (dated
July 31, 1964) had
only the following
reference_
to Cuba:
"Proposed

Cargill

On April
25, 1975, I was given
three.file
folders
containing
material
on the.above
subjects
by Mr. Joseph
Selzer
of the Inspector
General's
staff.
According
to Mr. Selzer,
his
review
of these
files
indicates
that
the basic
purpose
of
ZRRIFLE and its asset
QJWIN was the burglarization
of premises
outside
the United
States
for_the
purpose
of obtaining
cryptologic
materials.
He assures
me that
there
is nothing
in these
file~
which ref~~
explicitly
or implicitly
to assassination
or
"executive
action"
in any form.
His opinion
is that
clandestine operatives
of the type who wrote
the documents
contained
in these
files
would never commit to writing
anything
having
to do with the subject
of assassination.
The first
file
reviewed

Cable,
dated December 17, 1960, from Leopoldville
to Director.
This cable
concerned
a new asset
entering
the
picture
for the first
time,
who arrived
in Leopoldville
on
December 2.
The cable
states
that WIROGUE was the asset
·with
whom initial
contact
has been made in Leopoldville.
WIROGUE
is living
in the same hotel
as QJWIN with whom he conversed.
QJWIN has reported:
"WIROGUE had offered
him $300 per month
to participate
in intel
net and be member execution
squad.
When QJWIN said he not interested,
WIROGUE added there
would
for special
jobs.
Under QJWIN questioning,
WIROGUE

12.
Cable,
dated January
19, 1961, from Director
to
Luxembourg.
This cable
apparently
indicates
that
the Agency
plans to use QJWIN in Leopoldville
for more than one particular
mission.
It dontained
the following
statement:
"Inform
QJWIN we planning
use him Leopoldville
indefinitely
as discussed with him there."
13.
There follows
a series
of cables
reflecting
the
fact that
QJWIN proceeds
to Italy
to recruit
other
assets.
One cable
admonishes
field
agents
to tell
QJWIN not to give
reason
to any of the candidates
to be recruited
in Italy,
to
believe
that ODYOKE or.·· PBPRIME: is invofved.
I get the
impression
that
ODYOKE refers
to the U.S~ CIAr and PBPRIME
refers
to the intelligenc~
service
of some other
nation.
,
However,
no document
uncovered
so far confirms
this.
Cables
which follow
seem to indicate
that
the people
QJWIN was to
recruit
were intended
to be professional
burglars.
There is
no indication
that
they are intended
to be assassins.
There
are many other
indications
that
these
recruits
were intended
for safecracking
and breaking
ilnd entering.
QJWIN told
them
he could offer
a job for a large
firm which wanted certain
commercial
documents
stolen .

It
contains
a long discussion
of the Agency's
relationship
with
QJWIN and his main purpose
as an agent.
This dispatch
makes
it clear
that
the primary
purpose
of QJWIN's employment
by
the Agency is to recruit
burglars
~nd safe~rackers
for use
by the CIA.
This dispatch
contains
the first
reference
I
have found to the code word ZRRIFLE.
The one thing
that
seems
rather
unclear
is why QJWIN was initially
sent to Leopoldville,
and apparently
was contemplated
to return
to Leopoldville,
when
all of his recruiting
of safecrackers
and burglars
takes
place
in Europe.
The fact
that
his return
to Leopoldville
was contemplated
may be easily
seen from paragraph
one of this
cable.
The releasing
officer
on this
cable
was Mr. William
K. Harvey.

Memorandum dated

William

from AMS, re ZRRIFLE.
This memo discusses
possible
future
uses for QJWIN.
It seems perfectly
consistent
with the use of QJWIN merely
for the purpose
of recruiting
safecrackers
and burglars.
Paragraph
4 of this memo refers
to
some ZRRIFLE authorization

on two possible

for burglary
and safecracking.
In
this
attachment
there
are two references,
however,
which may
be somewhat disturbing:
One candidate
is stated
to be ''willing
to use gun";
the second
"wanted
to know if he should
be armed
for job--ready
to go to the end."

there

two pages of penciled

2.
Memorandum,
dated•January
31, 1961, for Chief,
Accounts
Branch,
Finance
Division,
from Justin
E. O'Donnell,
Subject:
Payments
to QJWIN.
Paragraph
1 of this
memorandum reads
11
as follows:
• QJWIN was recruited
in Frankfurt
1 November 1960
to undertake
a one-shot
mission
to the Belgian
Congo.
Because
the mission
potentially
involved
great
personal
risk
to him
and he was obliged
to separate
himself
from his business
affairs,
it was agreed
orally
by this
writer
with QJWIN that
his compensation
would be at the rate
of $1,000 per month,
plus his
expenses,
for a period
of not less
than one month and not more
than two months."
These two financial
memoranda, .numbers
1 and
2 here,
seem to indicate
a one-shot
purpose
for QJWIN in connection
with a Congo operation,
which seems inconsistent
with
many of the papers
in the operational
file
reviewed
above,
which indicated
an ongoing
relationship
with QJWIN for the
purposes
of recruiting
safecrackers
and burglars.
These
financial
memoranda
ar,e certainly
quite
consistent
with a plan
to use QJWIN for a one-shot
assassination
attempt
in the
Belgian
Congo.
It is unclear
that
merely
recruiting
safecrackers
and bu~glars
or even performing
safecracking
and
burglary

No other

is to be made without
the specific
approval
in

of the Chief,
FI/D."
Paragraph
2 reads,
"The
above has been personally
approved
by the Deputy Director
(Plans)."
I question
whether
such close
handling
of cable
traffic
is not unusual
ev~n in a case involving
safecracking
and burglary.
Perhaps
Harvey intended
traffic
~f more
sensitive
issues
to be passed
through
the ZRRIFLE channel.

In a large
manila
envelope
filed
immediately
after
a dispatch
to Luxembourg
from the Chief,.
KUTUBE, dated
September
30, 1963, is a large
manila
envelope
marked
"Documents
in Receipt
Supporting
ZRRIFLE Activities."
Within
this
envelope
are several
smaller
manila
envelopes,
one of
which is entitled
"ZRRIFLE, Receipts
for Accounting
Submitted
by WK Harvey,
Receipt
for Operational
Phone Calls
May 15, 1963."
Within
this
envelope
are two sheets- of yellow
legal
size paper
which contain
lists
of operational
expenses
submitted
by W.K.
Harvey covering
the period
April
13-21,
1963, all of which are
to be charged
as operational
expenses
to QJWIN/ZRRIFLE.
These
expenses
cover hotel
expenses
in Miami and Perine,
Florida,
long distance
hotel
calls
for these
locations,
plus $75 for a
boaf chartered
for operational
purposes
at,Islamorada,.
Florida.
A hotel
receipt
indicates
Harvey paid the bill
of a Mr. John A.
Wallston
of 56510 Wilshire
Boulevard,
Los 1'..ngeles,
California,
for the nights
of April
17, 18, and 19, and a Miami hotel,
probably
the Eden Roe.
These documents
are the first
indication
of any activities
within
the U.S. with respect
to ZRRIFLE.
Apparently
they did not involve
QJWIN but rather
other
activity,
perhaps
directed
at Cuba because
of his location
in
Miami.
Perhaps
Harvey should
be confronted
with this
listing
and asked to explain
~t.

perhaps
the subsequent·pages
are missing.
These first
two
pages portray
the objective
of ZRRIFLE to be ~hat of procurement
of code and cipher
materials
by burglary
and safecracking.
However,
subsequent
pages,
particularly
the last
four legal
size pages
in this
file,
contain
what appears
to
be the outline
of _something
which could be the establishment
of an "executive

although
these words are
not mentioned
nor is the word "assassination."
A copy of these
pages should
definitely

A memorandum dated
June 27, 1963, for Chief,
Foreign
Intelligence,
from William
K. Harvey,
Subject:
QJWIN.
This memo states
that
QJWIN is currently
not being used for
any operational
purposes.
It discusses
whether
or not he
should
be retained
as an agent.
Paragraph
2 seems to indicate
that
the executive
action
portion
of QJWIN's project,
if any,
has been terminated.
This paragraph
reads:
"As far as the
ZRRIFLE aspects
of this
operation
which has been covered
under
the QJWIN authorization
for security
reasons

Fletcher

perhaps
for minor accountings,

of this

.About 5:30 on Friday,
November 29, while
I was
sitting
arourid the fire
after
a game of golf
at Lloyd
Neck, the telephone
rang and I_ was advised
that
the
President~wanted
to speak with me.
I went to the phone
and the W:~ite House operator
said that
the.President·
wanted to speak with me, that he was.on
another
line;
and·would
I hold on for a minute.
After
a short
wait
the operator
told me that
someone had gone into
the
room and that
she would call
me back.

She called
me back in ·five minutes.
This gave
me a brief
chance
to puzzle
out what it was the President
~Qllted to say to me.
As it turned
out,
aided by some
news items
that
the President
was considering
appointing
a high-level
commission
to look into all the circumstances
of the assassination
of the President,
I was led to.put
this
as the first
possibility~
Soon the call
came through.
The
President
was on the line.
I told him how much my thoughts
had been with him in recent
days.
He thanked
me.
Then
in_a very kind expression
of appreciation
for what he
thought
I had _done for the country
over the years,
he said
he wished. me to do a job £or him. • I asked him what it was.
He said he was appointing
a·commission
to look into
all
the circumstances
surrounding
the assassination
and the later
killing
·of the man believed
responsible
for the assassination
This commission
would include
the Chief Justice,
members of
the House and Senate
fr.om both parties,
and two men outside
of ~overnrn¥nt,_
including
myself,
if I would serve.

..

without
hesitation
that
I was
I told
the President
I could be of service
to him ..
.prepared
~o serve
if he felt
I assumed that he had considered
and the nation.
I said that
my recent
job and that he did not consider
that
this
service
was· in any way an impediment.
He said he had carefully
considered
it and he felt
that,
on the contrary,
it would
be helpful.
I said I assumed that what he had told
me was
entirely
confidential.
He said it was until
it was announced
and he did not know the exact hour of that.
I said
I wouia,
of cou~se,
maintain
the confidence.

Here

one

that we study the use made of post office

the terms·and

post office

and whether
there

or whether
it is left more or less
to the whim of local
postmasters.
Oswald's
ability
to
hire a post office
in a fictitious
na~e and to use it for
the.receiot ... of firearms
seems to have facilitated
his criminal

Later the Co:nrnission might possibly
wish to
lllAke eome·suggestions
on this
subject.
{b)
I should be glad to see the conclusions

3. After disposing·of the question· of
information on
Os,,,ald, 1'lir. Rankin's staf.f shov,·ed u's: a detailed memorandum they_ had
prepared based on all of the information avail:i.ble to t~em, including
our O\Vncontribution concerning Os\vald 1 s stay in the USSR. This mater~:.tl, together \Vith some question,s speci'fically related to the material
we pro1vided, ,vill be for,varded to us by i\-lr. Ranldn' s staff.
It \I/as then .
'
suggested that a CL-'\ officer rr:ost familiar \Vith the ~aterial
provided
by CIA on the USSR aspects of the Os,i/ald case visit the Commis·sion in

:fylarina Os,vald. Vie agreed to send the appropriate officer to revie\v
this testimony but suggested that ,ve ,vait until after receipt of the material just sho\vn to us~

4. Members of ~'Ir. Rankin's staff then spoke about having found

commented on the fact that Os\vald had obt~ined employment in this
country in a photographic firm through a Russian friend.
He thought
· this might have a possible bearing on any cl~ndestine communications
systems he might have received from the Soviets.

5. Ivlembers of :rv1r. Rankin's staff then commented on the testi•
mony of l\1rs. Os\vald to the effect that the letters from her son regarding his desire to return to the United States had the appearance of being
dictated since they cont~ined none of his usu2.l grammatical
er·rors and
used legal language ,vith ,vhich he ,voulcl not have been familiar..
In this
connection, the fact that Lee Os\vald ....
vrote to the En1bassy requesting
help in arranging his return to the U.S. soon after receipt by the Embassy
of a telegram from the Department reporting on correspondence
,vith.
Oswald's mother seemed to indicate to members-of Mr. Ran!dn's staff
that the Soviets might have had access in some fashion to the contents
of the telegram .. They did not believe it \Vas coincidental that Os,vald 7 s
letter to the Embassy came i1nmediately on the heels of the telegram
from the Department.
This led to a discussion of the 2ppearance in the
press of another telegram or report, from the Embassy in J\1osco\v to
the Department.
Mr. Ra11-1dnsaid h~ _,vould underta!-ce to clarify this.
6. Mr. Willems noted that Mrs. Os\vald had introduced a statement to the effect that she suspected her son to be a CIA agent. 1vlr.
\Ville ms asked. ,vhether in fact Os\vald had been a CIA agent.. _Wrr., Helms
replied that he had not been. :tvir. "\Villems then asked if. there ,vere any~
way of proving thi~. l'v1r. Helms first remarked that in him and·1V1r.
Murphy
the Commission
had the t\vo Clandestine Services officers \vho
-.,,
w:----- ·• -·
certainly would kr10\v \Vhether or noLQs.....
Y@la haUeen an ?:gent for CIA
in the Soviet Union. He then said that the Con11nission ,vould have to
ta.Keh1s word-f orthe fact that Os\vald had not been an agent.. Tu'Ir. Ranldn
interjected the vie\v that the Commission had not.adopted this procedure
,vith other agencies and v1ondered ,vhether there \Vas not some \Vay to
clarify this point more effectively ior the Commission.
One suggestion·
he in?-de ,vas to have :rv1r
.. Dulles, ,vho is fan1iliar ,vith CIA records
procedures,
revie,v the material \Vhich \Vould normally be held on agznts
and report to the Commission.
Another suggestion v,as to follo,v the
lead of the Director of the FBI ,vho for\varded an affidavit to the Com- .
mission regarding the nature of FBI relations ,vith Os\vald.

7. A considerable part of the meeting from this point for,vard
consisted· of a revie,v by :rvir. Rankin and his staff of the gaps in their
investigation to date. They noted that the most significant gap appeared
• in the Mexican phase.
For example, they had no record of Os,vald's

~aily movements \Vhile in !viexic9 City nor could they. coqfirn1 the date
of his departure or his mode of travel.
The original assumption that
he had returned by bus could not be proven.
Several possibilities
Vlere
discussed ,vhereby the Com1nission could fill in the gaps of its investigation of the Mexican phase .. The suggestion ,vas made that tb.e n1ost
effective ,vay of resolving the questions they had ,voul~ be to have a
member of the Commission visit IVIexico City and discuss the issues on
the spot with those A1nerican and f/~exican officials directly concerned.
Mr. Helms noted that it ,,,ould be possible for a men1ber of the Commission to visit our Chief of Station \vho \Vould then be able to ,vork out
,vith the Warren Commission staff 1nember the best \yay to handle intervie\vs ,vith Iv1exican police officials, particul3.rly if it is desired that
Our Chief of Station ,vould also
these intervie .vs be informal in nature.
be able to put the vVarren Commission staff member in contact \vith the
FBI officials and Immigration 2.nd Naturalization
Service officers stationed
in 1'Iexico City. ·!Ar. Helms cautioned that our Chief of Stationfurould be)~
under State Department cover)lnd that it \Vould be proper to advise the
Department of the planned visit and upon arrival to meet briefly ,vith the
Ambassador or Minister Counselor before·proceeding
to \Vork out details
,vith the CIA Chief of Station.

8. In connection with the rv1exicari phase of the investigation,
members of Mr. Rankin'=s staff questioned 11r. Helms and iv'.ir. Rocca reg~rding
the extent of the CIA. file on Os,v~ld for the period 8 October to 22 !-lovcmber
1963. They questioned the sanitized extracts \Vhich they had been sho\vn
and ,vondered if there ,vere not more. T\Ir Rocca summarized
the n1a- '
terials that _had come to the attention of the Secret Service, or had been
disseminated
to the Secret Service, i1nmediately after the assassination.
Mr. Rocca said there ,vas .not additional substantive i11formation and that
the sanitized version 'seen by the Commission constituted the sum of our
holdings.
1-1:r. Helms then explained that as a 1natter of practice ,ve did
not release actual copies of our messages because they contained codewords and digraphs ,vhich ,vould be unintelligible to a person not familiar
With them. He added, ho,vever, that he would be happy to sho'.v the file
with the original messages to any strtff :rr.e1nber of the \Varren Commission
v,ho ·might come to visit him at Langley.

believe that the infor_mation on Osi.vald ,vas unusual enough to have
caused recipients to take special measures ,vhich might conceivably
have led to a closer· scrutiny of Lee Harvey Os\vald and his movements.
lvir. Helms pointed out that ttie inforn1ation on Os1vald's visit to the
Cuban and Soviet embassies in ?\'lexico City came from telephone intercepts ,vhich \vere placed on both embassies.
These intercepts
,vere
recorded.on
tape and revie,.ved by persons at our St2.tion for any information affecting U. S. security.
Such information is routinely passed
to other agencies and entered in CLt\ files. Given th2 enormous bulk
which is involved, the tapes are not kept on file but erased after a brief
period of time. Thus the information on Os\vald ,vas similar to that
provided on other American citiz~ns ,vho might have made contacts of
this type. In Os,vald' s case, it ,vas the combination of visits to both
Cuban and Soviet Embassies ,vhich caused the Mexico City Station to
report this to Headquarters
an9- Os·\vald 1 s record of defection to the
Soviet Union ,vhich prompted the Headquarters
dissemination.
At the
conclusion of his remarks on this subject, 1\/'"ir.Helms specified that
the inforn1ation he had given 1,'lr. Rank.in ,v·as extren1ely sensitive and
that the very ·existence of these telephone intercepts had to be very
carefully protected.

10. The Commission,
1'.1r. Ran.l.dn said, ,vould be interested in
any information held by CIA on Jack Ruby. I'.-lr. Rankin said the Coinmission staff had prepared a roundup on Ruby, a copy of \Vhich he handed
Mr. Helms.
He said he ,vould appreciate any file reflections
or commen_ts

Mr. Gray asked for t;he DCI' s views on ,the capability'
of the intelligen_s:e
estimnting
mechanism t9 avoid being 1 influenced
by the wishful -thinking
of
responsible
offi.daLJ,
as in the case. of the el:'.r,>~eous estimate
on Cuba prior
~o the Sovi~t; 'missile
crisis
in 1962, Mr, Mc:Con~ said that, ri better"example
'than Cuba ·w.:is the estimate
on Brazil ,,hi.ch was bitterly

later saw the accuracy of the es'ttmate proved

that_ they should have r·epresentation
on COMOR_

ori COMOR,

added then a similar
request would be made by
other connnano.s such as NORADand CINCEUR.• Mr. Coyne observed that th~

representation
desired by SAC was on. behalf of the SAC Commande.r in his role-.- 1 '

estimated
5,000 Soviets had departed
since May 1, leaving 2,000 on the is+a_nd., The Cubans now have control
of· air defense and/ coastal

developed ·complete information
on deployments and facilities
for the Army, Navy,, and Air Force, and he particularly
noted
that these missions have verified
that there is sufficient
logistic
support for a 75,000-man military

The Group_ agreed on a .complete review of MONGOOSE

Mr. Johnson said that th.e "massive activity II would have
to come from within,

to the Group- a plan 'for giving Cuban exiles more of a free hand,

bility
and de~irability
of·such a proiram, and Mr~·Johnson
agreed that.he
had reservations
as well.
.

'

\

,

Mr. McCone said that he had received the impression
that although high levels oJ' our Government wanted.increased
activity,
they still
want to keep it at a lO\(Jnoise level,'\
but Mr. McCone·did not believe this would be possible
and-.he
felt that any sabotage would be blamed on the United States.
Mr. McCone cited the enormous number of telepl}one calls,
directed
at CIA at ·the time the skin, divers landed in east
Cuba,· and the time that 'the Cuban exile students
shot up the
apartment house.
Mr. McCone therefore
urged that respo'nsible
officials
be prepared to accept a higher noise level if they
want to get on with operations.
The Attorney General, in p~rtial
rebuttal,
said that 1 the
reasons ~eople had sue~ concern were (a) the fact that the Ekin
divers were Americ'ans, and (b ); the fact that t9e student activity
was ir~esponsible
and foolish
-- and if either
of these had
• •
in fact been engireered
by the United States it would have
been a great mistake.
The Attorney Geri~ral also related
the
possibility
of attrihutability
to the importance o'f the
whether we are going
particular
undertal<:ing, and 1 he questioned
down the right road or whether more 11direct action II were n'ot
indicated,
He urged that alternative
and imaginative
plan~
, b~ developed.
.

Mr. McCone said that internal
restrictions
a~e so rigid
that internal
uprisings
would surely be brutally
suppresied\
(It was agreed that the current guidelines
did not riall for
inciting
such an uprising.).

Mr. McCone and General Carter explained· the ;tremendous
efforts
necessary to insure that operations
such as·the sabotage
operation
previously
authorized
cannot be pinned directly
on

various cont:tngenqy military
plans based on a variety.of
v.ossible situations,

'the presence o:f.'bloc offensive

Dr. Scoville
and Colonel Steakl~y we~e presen~ at this
Group meeting for an item regarding
reconnaissance
-of Cuba.
Ip wa~ pointed 9ut that the CIA is '~estricted
to using its
high-performance
vehicle in the southeast
quadrant of Cuba,
because of SAM sites."
It was questione'd whether this was a
~easonable restriction
at that time, particularly
when ~AMs
*
we.re al~ost .certainly
not bperat1onal.?
Colonel Steakley and Dr •. Scoville
described
a spectrum
,_of reconnaissance.
act·i Vi ties which 1 could be undertaken,
ranging from low-level,
Navy fighters
through drones, up to
the Agency's capabilities,
particularly
equipped
with new radar
countermeasures.
As a result
of 1the discussion
there was agreement tha,t the Department df Defense and· the· CIA shpuld get
together
on recommendations for targets
within Cuba that require
coverage, and on recommendations as to how·to ach:1.eve this

There was some discussion
of the desirability
of mining
Cuban waters, using nonattributable
mines app~aring 'to be homemade and .:.laid by ~mall aircraft
operated by Cubans.
It was agfeed that
Chairman of the Special

would act as
Group (Augmented) for the tim~ being.

It was agreed that four. major points whic~ had emerged
from this meetine; wer.e: _(1) we ought; to go all-out
for increased
i~telligence;
(2) the.re should be con~iderably
more ~abotage;
(.5) restrictions
on attributability

The DCI pointed out that the ,
Agency is now restricted
to using the U-2 in the southeastern
quadrant
of Cuba, because1 of SAMsites.
It was questioned whether this was a
reasonable restriction

since the SAMs were

:Minutes of the Octob~r 9, 1962 Meeting
• '. '.-•of, the· Special Group _(Augmented)
1

Pre~e~t for this meeting were the Attorney General,
Mr, Bun~y, M~. Johnson, Mr, Gilpat~ic,
Generai Taylor, Mr~ McColonel Steakley,
Cone, Mr, Wi1son, Dr. Charyk, Pr, Scoville,
and Colonel Ledford, CIA.
•
The Group discussed
various possibilities
of accomplishing reconnaissance
of Cuba, ranging from.low-level
coverage
by tactical
aircraft
to high-performance
aircraft
and drones.
Overflights-- and periph,era.l flights
were discussed.
It was
agreed that the first
~riority
is one high~performance
mission
in the western pa.rt of the .island, to be accompl:;Lshed by all\ out ELINT support,
and depending on the results
of th.is; a
number of similar
sorties
might be mounted,
(The first
mission
was later approved1bY higher authority,
with the decision
on
the second proposition
left open.
The entire package was to
be discussed
at the USIB and by the Chiefs on Wednesday,
October 10. )
Along with the minutes of this Octobe.r 9 Meeting the·re
was in file a memorandum from Mr. Parrott
to Mr, Bundy, dated
October 11, 1962 .. It was reflected
•1n Mr. Parrott's
memorandum
that Mr. Gilpatric
had called at 2:15 P.M, to say he.and Mr.~
McCone·had finally
agreed that the one hi,gh-performance
flight
would be flown as a military
flight
with a SAC pilot.
CIA had
wanted to stick to the existing/system
for the first
flight,
simply to avoid any delay,
The SAC pilot would require sofue
additional
training
because the equipment in the improved
vehicle was new to him, but Mr. Gilpatric
and Mr, McCone
appar~ntly
felt that this was an acceptable
delay and it was
hoped to get the flight
off over the weekend,
It was further
stated in Mr, Parrott 1 s memorandum that it seemed agreed that
within the terms of the authorization
given by higher authority
it would. be necessary to go back for approval of the next
pha-_se. contemplating
two or three more high-perform'ance
mission\;;:
i
and Mr. Gilpatric
seemed to feel that.the
discussion
which had
taken place with higher authority
was explicit
enough to get
•
an emergency authority
by telephone.
Mr. Parrott
further
informed Mr. Bundy that tl1e · Cover Comm:ittee
(Messrs.
Charyl<:,
Hilsman, Scoville,
Parrott,
"et al 11 ) had met that morning and
had agreed on a new cover story for a military
p1lot and a
revised cover story for civilian
pilots,
and with the necessary
changes it was, thought that. the cover story would be read;y
pointed out to Mr. Bundy that,on
that- afternoon.
Mr. Parrott
the milj_ tary side, the flight 1 is characterized
1 as military
reconnaissance
of the periphery
ot the target area, with particular reference
to the Secretary'of
State's
recent comments to
the OAS Ministers
to the effect that we are increasing
surveillance activities.

on·

There was alsq an Oct9}:>er 12, 1962 addendum to the above.:.
mentioned October 11 memorandum from Mr. Par'rott to lf.tr. Bundy:,·
stating:
"Later." 1 The memorandum related that~ accordir:ig to
•Mr. Kflocke, Mr. McCone .had decided the day before (October 11)
that these flights
must be either entirely
overt -or entirely
~oi~~t, and he didn't particularly
~are which s6 long as they
were ,accomplished as soon as possible:
In Mr. McCone's absence,
General Carter had come to an agreement· with General McKee,
Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Forc(e, along those li-nes on
October 11; later,
however, Mr. Gilpatric
said that this was •
not his.understa.nding
of the terms of.authorization
from higher
authority.
Mr. Gilpatric
felt that the idea was that auriiformed
••
pilot should operate the Agency 1 s vehic~e.

: '

/

.

Ori Octob~r 12 at 1~:45, General Carter.had
a meeting with
Mr. Bundy and at that time General Carter stated that the·Agency
operation was ready to go except for weather, and that this
would-hold it up until at least Sunday, anq meantime the SAC
pilot would have received the necessary training.
It was agreed
that if the pilot was sufficiehtly
trained by the earliest
time
the mission could· be mounted, -the 'flight would ~go, with all
other arrangements within the Agency framework.
If the pilot
were not ~eady by the time the vehicle was re~dy, the missiori
would be mounted as a completely Agency operation,
i.e.,
with
a civilian pilot.
Accoraing to Mr.- Lay, the usm had taken.
the following actions at its October 10, 1962 meeting with .
respect to the targets
listed in the COMORpaper of October 6:
(1) The Group I targets were not"discussed
by·usm,
the implication being that there was no problem from the point of vievt J
of usm•s jurisdiction.
(2) :Groups II. and III,.-,should be .
covered as rapidly as possible
initially,,
and after that the
(3)
COMOR
frequency of coverage would be further examined.
was to re-do the section of the October 6 paper dealing with
Group _IV, with targets
to be broken out in categories
of p~iorty,
and_ usm would consider this new paper on October 17. usm
did not con~ider any operational
as~e6ts, but confined themselves to the importance of the targets
and the frequen~y
of coverage.

~GPSECRET.
The secretary
of State expressed concern at the Agency's:
planned coverage of Cuba, invo~ving extensive
peri~heral
coverage as well as two legs directly
over Cu?an air space:,
·' all in one flight.
He said he had no objection
to the
periphe_ra.l pa·rts ,and, in-- fact, thought it useful to continue
to establish
our right to fly over international
waters.- •·On
the other hand, be recognized the nec~ssity
of obtaining
vertical,
coverage of the Isle of Pines and the eastern portion of Cuba
;
hcn.rever, that, it was unwise to combine
at this time. ··He felt,
extensive
overflying
of international
waters with actual overflights.
~He pointed out that the 16ng peripheral
flight~
would draw undue attention
to the mission and, fJrther,
should
the aircraft
fall into enemy hands after an overflight
had
occurred.,' this would put the United States in a very poor position
for stariding on its rights to overfly international·
waters~
1

Taking the,se views into account, the Agency I s pl 9rts to · •
this proposed coverage into four parts:
the Is1e ot Pines;
7 break
• the area roughly east of longitude
77 west; and two legs a1ong
the. coast,· one north and one south.

_Within this framework, higher authority
gave 9pproval this
morning for two additional
missioni to be added to tha one for
which authority
is currently
outstanding.
Priority
wfl;J. be
given to the two 6verflights.
• (A notation
on the file copy .
of these. Special Group minutes states)that
as ·or this morning
.
it· appears that weather will not perm;tt a flight
until at least•
\'Friday, and longer range weather prospects .are· not very good,
.\
consequently
it will be some li t~/le t~me before these t;h'ree •

In connection w)ith the minutes of this .meeting, the Special

note. for the file dated October 25,
1962, stating that COMORlater recommended that the Bay of
Pigs area should be looked at since. it had not been seeri since.

: that after considerable

(In quotingJthe, minutes or this September 10 meeting in a

RE:

GUS ALEX
ANTI-RACKETEERING

It has been reported
by the Swiss Central
Police
Bureau that Alex's employer,
De Luxe Cigarette
Service,
Incorporated,
certified
that he has worked in their publicit~
department
since 1957 and has never given any reason for
complaints.
•
It is noted that Alex claims income from this
company which company for years has been reportedly
controlled
by hoodlums.
Alex now is reportedly
in charge of this company
having taken it over from a close friend
and fellow hoodlum,
Edward Vogel.
Alex on numerous occasions
has been observed
at this location
with his chauffeur
and body guard Nathan
"Butch" Ladon.
In 1958 Alex was summoned to Washington,
D.C., to
appear before the McClellan
Senate Rackets Committee investigating
hoodlum infiltration
into labor and business
in Chicago.
Alex refused
to cooperate
and furnished
no information,
taking
refuge behind the 5th Amendment.
He refused
to answer all
questions
except for his name and address.

JFK Law 10(a)2

Captain William Duffy, Operating
Director,
Intelligence
Section,
Organized Crime Division,
Chicago
Police Department,
advised that Gus Alex is a tpp ranking
member of organized
crime in Chicago and is closely
allied
with the top ranking members of the hoodlum element.
Duffy
advised further
that he has maintained
continuous
investigation
of Alex for years and of Alex's affiliations
with the De Luxe
1
Cigarette
Service,
Incorporated.
Duffy stated
that Alex
has been completely
uncooperative
and that there is no question
concerning
his involvement
with Chicago's
underworld
in
organized
crime.

Informant T-3 said that ANGELOBRUNOmet on the evening of
October 14, 1959, with SAMROSE, Philadelphia
City Councilman,
to discuss BRUNO's proposed contract
with the city of
Philadelphia
for removal of trash.
T-3 said that BRUNO
had indicated
that the land purchased,
described
below,
was'about to be concluded and that POLLINAwhomade the down
,payment on the land was not DOMENICKPOLLINA, Philadelphia
Top Hoodlum. T-3 did not know if this POLLINAwas the
relative
of DOMENICKPOLLINA.
On October 7, 1959, U.S. Game Management Agent
in New Jersey HARRY:,E.GREENWALD
advised SA IRVING R. DEAN
that an-800 plus acre plot of land on the south side of
Mad Horse Creek in Salem County, N.J. was owned by RIESS
EWENof Salem, N.J.
This land was said to be surrounded
by a 2500 acre plot owned by THOMASDICKSON, Clerk of the
County Court of Salem, N.J. who is fighting
the sale of
the 800 acres owned by EWENto one (FNU) POLLINA, described
as a South Philadelphian
who had made. a down payment of
$3500 toward a purchase price of \$75.00 per acre for EWEN's
acreage.
It was said that the state of New Jersey had
offered EWEN$35.00 an acre:Cfor his land as a proposed
public shooting grounds for wild ducks.
GREENWALD
also said that the Salem, N.J. City
Council unanimously opposed the sale of EWEN's acreage
when it became known that the acreage was intended for a
garbage disposal
area.
Two weeks after this action,
however,
it is alleged that the entire
City Council of Salem, N.J.
reversed
its decision
and voted .fc>l'.' the sale of EWEN's
property,
knowing that it was to be used as a garbage
disposal
area.
1
'.~

The property was described
as being only
accessible
by water and that the only obstacle
holding up
the sale of the land at the present time is ;nhe riparian
rights
to the land which is now in the process of litigation.

en October 19, 1959, GREENWALD
advised SA DEAN
that THOMASDICKSON, described
above, was contacted
by an
individual,
presumably a JOHN POLLINA, in an endeavor to
GREENWALD
purchase his 2500 acre plot in Salem, N.J.
allegedly
was told by DICKSONthat it was demanded that
he set a price for his land and that DICKSONwould be
contacted
Wednesday evening, October 21, 1959, for his
answer.
GREENWALD
said that DICKSONhad called him and
related
this information.
DICKSONwas said to be extremely
worried over what may happen to him or his family if he
does not sell the land.
By letter
October 26, 1959, the Newark Division
advised that. THOIVIAS
PANCOASTDICKSONon October 20, 1959,
was interviewed
by SA..ROBERTD. ALDRICHand advised
as
follows:
DICKSONdid not know other than from rumor who
was involved in the sale of land to the land adjoining
his property
for the purpose of using it as a garbage
disposal
area.
He had been approached to sell his land
by CHARLESACTON, Swedesboro, N.J., a real estate dealer.
No threats
were made to him but ACTONtold him that the
people he represented
"had to have the land" and for him
to name his price and they would buy.
DICKSONhas heard from sources unrecalled
that
the POLLINAs were the persons behind the project
but he
observed that there appeared to be a great deal of political
pressure
coming from the .State of New Jersey regarding
the
matter.
It appeared that the state wanted to use Salem
County as a dump ground for the whole state since dumping
on the North Jersey meadows has been stopped.
N.J.,. told
A. W. W. HOWELL,Box 459, Parsippany,
DICKSONthat the state of New Jersey had made an official
investigation
concerning
the matter so he, DICKSON,
called a Detective
Sergeant EMIL DALINT of the New Jersey
State Police at West Trenton, N. J., who admitted··.to him
that such an investigation
had been made and a file
existed but that he preferred
that DICKSONtalk to his
s upe.rior, Deputy Attorney General JOHN J. BlJRGIN for any
official
information.
DICKSONdid not proceed further.

PH 92-444
DICKSONsaid that local meetings have been held in
Salem in an effort
to get an ordinance passed forbidding
any such dumping and an official
of the City Health Department,
one JOHN ZEMHAMPSKI
(phonetic)
has appeared and argued
strongly against passage of such restrictions.
In DICKSON's
opinion this man had no business at such a meeting.
DICKSON
said there had been many rumors a.round Salem concerning large
payoffs·- to New Jersey state officials
but DICKSONcannot
substantiate
any of these.
DICKSONsaid h~ would_ attempt
to cooperate with the FBI in every way should threats
be made
to him as he definitely
did not intend to sell his land for
a dump.

that they were then _ready to purchase land at Salem, NoJo
but BRUNOfurnished
no additional
information.

venture.

to be the most active in the proposed business venture.
It
was said that Chief Magistrate
JOSEPH HERSCHhad a definite
interest
in the matter.
On October 15, 1959, T-3 said that
HERSCHwas a close, personal friend·of
BRUNO.
_

T-3 said that the land in Salem, No J. had been
purchased wtth a $20,000 down payment and had a $47,000
balance remaining.

For information
of New Orleans,
SANTOTRAFFICANTE,
JR. spends a considerable
portion of time at his Miami,
Florida residence,
523 Northeast 71st Street and it is
suggested that New Orleans in the future when furnishing
information
concerning TRAFFICANTE, include Miami as
recipiento
For further
information
New Orleans TRAFFICANTE's
wife JOSEPHINE was involved in an automobile accident
in
Hospital,
Tampa 5/18/66 and was confined St. Joseph's
Tampa from dateoof accident until 6/19/66. •

In addition,
records airport
parking,
Miami
Airport,
indicate
that TRAFFICANTE's automobile was not
on the parking lot during the period of 5/27/66 to 6/4/66,
which would suggest from past ·experience
that TRAFFICANTE
was actually
present
in the Miami, Florida
area from
5/27/66 to 6/4/660
Likewise,
records
indicate
that
1
TRAFFICANTEs automobile was on the parking lot from 6/4/66
until 6/10/66 which would suggest that TRAFFICANTEwas n.ot
in Miami. Possibility
therefore
exists
that MARCELLO's
visit
mentioned in referenced
airtel
would have been to
TRAFFICANTE's Miami residence
instead
of his Tampa residenceo

docid-34489575.pdf - Page 3

TP 92-1

Furthermore,
TP 120-C on 7/6/66 indicated
that
TRAFFICANTE, his wife, their daughter,
and her family had
spent some of the July 4th weekend at least at TRAFFICANTEis
Sta Petersburg
Beach residenqe
located at 3610 El Centro.
Likewise,
records of the airport
parking lot 1 Miami, indicate that TRAFFICANTEis automobile was parked on the airport
parking lot from 6/27/66 to 7/2/66 at which time it was
removed from.the
lot at 12:52 Pom. Records further
reflect
that the car again appeared on the parking lot at 6:07
7/2/66 and remained on .the parking lot until 11:22 Pom., .
7/6/660
From TRAFFICANTE's habit pattern,
it thus appears
that he was out of the Miami area from 6/27/66 to the afternoon of 7/2/66 and then from evening of 7/2/66 to 7/6/66.

New Orleans s·attention
is called to New Orleans

Since that time, according to NK T-1, subject has made

although he has seen her on

It is. to be noted that during thelf5;~~~(t'lE~i8tlici:i

vestigation
the subject's
mother, ANNAARCHER,was interviewed
at
her home by SA VICTORJ. CAMPI, on July 6, 1960, concerning an
abandoned car found near her home. Upon requesting
a paper upon
which she said she had written
the license number of the abandoned
car, Mrs. ARCHERstarted
to enter the next room, at which time a
woman's voice, in a loud,·tone,
objected to an effort to open the
door.
Mrs. ARCHERsaid her daughter was making a ph9ne call and
that when the call was completed she would obtain the requested
item.
Shortly thereafter,
the subject emerged from the next room
stating
she had been interrupted
making a very important telephone
call -- a call to Cuba. She did not identify
the individual
to
whom she was talking nor did she furnish any information
con./
cerning this telephone conversa_tion. ~

On October 6, 1960, Captain WALTER/HUTTON,
Union Beach,

and since that time her mother, ANNAARCHER,has been helping to
rear the two children from that marriage.
Captain HUTTONdid not,
know how the subject made her living, 'but it was his opinion she.
probably had boyfriends
who kept her, that she did a bit of·
traveling
with her boyfriends
but always returned
to visit her
children.

Cuba and Miami. Her part was only a minor one, she
says.
"She is reluctant

Since that time, according to NK T-1, subject has made
no further mention of this matter, although he has seen her on
several occasions.
NK T-1 said he had heard it rumored that
the subject has been involved in the sale of guns to Cuba in the
past, as well as having visited
Cuba since CASTROtook power, but
did not know this of his own knowledge.
NK T-1 said that ARCHERis divorced from her husband,
has ••two children and. resides with her mother, ANNAARCHER,on
He added that she is employed
Route 36, Union Beach, New Jersey.
as a cashier at Ye Cottage Inn, Keyport, New Jersey.
It is to be noted that during the course of another investigation
the subject's
mother, ANNAARCHER,was interviewed
at
her home by SA VICTORJ. CAMPI, on July 6, 1960, concerning an
abandoned car found near her home. Upon requesting
a paper upon
which she said she had written the license number of the abandoneq.
car, Mrs. ARCHERstarted
to enter the next room, at which time a
woman's voice, in a loud tone, objected to an effort to open the
door.
Mrs. ARCHERsaid her daughter was making a phone call and
that when the call was completed she would obtain the requested
item.
Shortly thereafter,
the subject emerged from the next room
stating
she had been interrupted
making a very important teleptione
call -- a call to Cuba. She did not identify
the. individual
to
•
whom she was talking nor did she furnish any information
concerning this telephone conversation.
On October 6, 1960, Captain WALTERHUTTON,Union Beach,
New Jersey, Police Department, advised SA CAMPI that the subject
had two brothers,
noting that one brother,
FREDDIEARCHER,was
a well-known boxer.
He noted that the subject had been married
to a local man but had stopped living together in the late 1940s
and since that time her mother, ANNAARCHER,has been helping to
did not
rear the two children from that marriage.
Captain HUTTON
know how the subject made her living,
but it was his opinion she
probably had boyfriends who kept her, that she did a bit·of
traveling
with her boyfriends
but always returned to visit her
children.
He said the subject was also known under the name
RUBYKORBIN.
In the course of another investigation,
Alcohol and
TObacco Tax Division (AT'ID) Agent JOHN C. MULLIN, on January 18,
1960, advised SA LINCOLNJ. STOKESthat the last girlfriend
of •
CHARLIE"THE BLADEuTOURINEwas a girl named EVELYNARCHER
(phonetic) of Houston, Texas.
He said this girl was married and
may be involved in gun purchasing and selling.

On 1/24/61,
JOSEPH QUAIL, Health
town Township, New Jersey, who requested
his identity
be concealed,
advised SA HERBERTL. BLOMhe has known the subject
for many years and that several months ago, while talking
to
her at a bar, she was praising
FIDEL CASTROand what he was
doing for Cuba. Later in the cQnversation
she asked QUAIL
how he felt about making a "buck" or if he cared how he made
it.
QUAIL, in going along with the conversation,
stated to
her that he was interested
in making mon~y, to which she replied that she was expecting
a friend from either Cuba or
Miami (not recalled
by QUAIL) and that when he arrived she
would have them get together.
Since that time, according to
QUAIL, she has made no further
mention of, this matter,
al though
he has seen her on several
Qccasions.
QUAIL said he had heard
it rumored that ARCHERhas been involved . in the sale of guns to
; Cuba in the past as well as having visited
CUba since CASTRO
~ took power but did not know -this of his· own knowledge. \j\

BARRETO,340 East 80th St., NYC, who has in the past
acted as a Cuban contact of attorney JAMESDONOVAN
in
his negotiations
for the release of various Cuban
prisoners. - DE LOS ijEROSadvised that in April, 1963,
one DANCHAPPELwas released from a Cuban prison.
CHAPPELis reputed to be a cattle breeder in the Miami,
Florida area and was alleged to be a politician

In 1960 and 1961, CHAPPELwas

lost a great deal of money in this venture, whi<h
money had been given to him for use in the gambling
venture in Cuba by an unknown syndicate of individuals
in the United States.
CHAPPELis the only individual
that DE LOS HEROSfelt might fit the description
of the American citizen
formerly in a Cuban prison
who was financing raids on Cuba and who was a friend
of the subject.
NY sources familiar with anti-CASTRO
activity
in the NY area, although advising that the
subject was unknown to them, stated that from time
to time they would make appropriate
discreet
inquiries
through other. sources of theirs in the anti-CASTRO field
in the United States in order to determine the subject 1 s
identity
and that if any information
of value along
these lines is developed, they will immediately notify
the NYO.
A review of the files of the NYOreflects
no information :identifiable
with the subject;
however,
it was noted in NY file 105-55031-164 that a letterhead
memorandum dated 3/25/63, at Miami, Florida,
captioned
11
HAITIAN REVOLUTIONARY
ACTIVTTIES; IS-HAITI", on pages
3, 6 and 7, contain information relative
to one ALBERTO
BAYO, aka Captain Bayo, who was formerly connected
;·
with Alpha 66 and whose identity
inreality
is EDUARDO,
PEREZ, residing
351 Southwest 6th St., Apartment 2,
Miami, Florida.
On page 13 of this letterhead
memorandum
PEREZ is described as a Cuban exile who was very
talkative,
unpredictable
and undepenq.able.
